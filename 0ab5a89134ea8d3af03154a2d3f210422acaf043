ARCH: Established modular architecture with concerns for cross-cutting functionality. Risk-aware and performance monitoring aspects implemented as Rails concerns for easy model integration.

RISK: High initial feature risk due to novel integration of five different methodologies. Mitigated through modular design allowing incremental adoption.

PERF: Initial setup optimized for development. Production configurations include Redis caching, database pooling, and monitoring infrastructure.

TEST: Test structure planned but not yet implemented. Will follow TDD approach with unit tests for concerns and integration tests for scaling service.

EXP: Combining terminal productivity (tmux) with web framework (Rails) creates unique development experience. Progressive Commit Protocol ensures traceable development journey.
