# 📚 The Problem

## Modern Rails applications face multiple challenges:

- 🎯 **Risk Blindness** - Deploy and pray
- 🐌 **Performance Degradation** - Found in production
- 🔧 **Platform Lock-in** - Works on my machine™
- 📉 **Knowledge Loss** - Why did we do this?

---

# 💡 The Solution

## Agentic Rails: A Framework That Thinks

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  include RiskAware           # Knows its risks
  include PerformanceMonitored # Tracks its speed
end
```

**Result**: Self-aware models that actively manage their lifecycle

---

# 🎯 Core Innovation #1

## Risk-Aware Development

### Every model assesses risk across 4 dimensions:

```ruby
product.risk_report
# => {
#      score: 0.73,
#      level: :high,
#      categories: {
#        feature: 0.8,      # New functionality
#        dependency: 0.9,   # External services
#        model: 0.5,       # Data complexity
#        environmental: 0.7 # Security/Legal
#      },
#      mitigations: [
#        "Add feature flags",
#        "Implement circuit breaker"
#      ]
#    }
```

# 📊 Risk in Action

## Real-time Risk Monitoring

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     RISK MONITORING DASHBOARD            ║
╠══════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ Feature Risk:      ████████░░ HIGH       ║
║ Dependency Risk:   ██████████ CRITICAL   ║
║ Performance Risk:  ████░░░░░░ MEDIUM     ║
║ Security Risk:     ██░░░░░░░░ LOW        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝

🚨 ALERT: Supplier API down - risk elevated
```

**Automatic mitigations trigger at thresholds**

# 🚀 Core Innovation #2

## Progressive Commit Protocol

### Every commit is an experiment:

```bash
git commit -m "experiment: add caching layer

Hypothesis: Caching will reduce DB load by 40%

Results:
- ✅ Database queries reduced by 47%
- ✅ P95 response time: 87ms
- ❌ Cache invalidation issues with bulk updates

Risk Assessment:
- Feature Risk: MEDIUM
- Dependency Risk: LOW
- Performance Impact: POSITIVE
- Security Risk: LOW"
```

---

# 📈 Development Journey

## Complete Traceability

```
commit 5463f7d
│
├─ HYPOTHESIS: Caching will improve performance
├─ METHOD: Rails.cache with 5-minute expiry
├─ RESULTS: 47% query reduction, 87ms P95
├─ LEARNINGS: Simple TTL insufficient
└─ ALTERNATIVES: GraphQL DataLoader (rejected)
```

**Every decision documented for future developers**

---

# ⚡ Core Innovation #3

## Performance Monitoring

### Method-level tracking built-in:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  include PerformanceMonitored

  def calculate_discount
    with_performance_tracking do
      # Complex calculation
    end
  end
end
```

```
[PERFORMANCE] ProductsController#show
├─ Duration: 127ms
├─ Memory: 45,230 objects
├─ Queries: 3
└─ Cache hits: 12/15 (80%)
```

# 🔄 Automatic Scaling

## Risk-Based Scaling Decisions

```ruby
ScalingService.analyze_and_scale
# Evaluates:
# - Request rate vs capacity
# - Memory/CPU utilization
# - Error rates
# - Risk factors

# Decision:
# => :horizontal (add instances)
# => :vertical (increase resources)
# => :cache_optimization
# => :database_optimization
```

**Scaling triggered by risk, not just metrics**

---

# 🌍 Core Innovation #4

## Universal Build System

### Works Everywhere™

```makefile
# Detects platform automatically
FreeBSD → gmake, pkg
macOS   → make, brew
Linux   → make, apt/yum

# Sentinel-based tracking
.make-sentinels/
  ├── system-deps    ✓
  ├── ruby-deps      ✓
  ├── db-migrated    ✓
  └── tests-passed   ✓
```

**One command setup: `make setup`**

---

# 🧪 Testing Strategy

## Property-Based Testing

```ruby
property "risk scores always normalized" do
  property_of {
    risks = random_risk_values()
  }.check(1000) do |risks|
    score = calculate_risk(risks)
    assert score.between?(0, 1)
  end
end
```

### Coverage:
- **Unit**: 47 test cases
- **Integration**: 10 workflows
- **Properties**: 15 invariants (1000+ generated cases)

# 🎁 Bonus: Quick Start

## Your First Risk-Aware Model

```ruby
# 1. Add to Gemfile
gem 'agentic-rails'

# 2. Include concerns
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  include RiskAware
  include PerformanceMonitored

  def feature_risk
    total_amount > 1000 ? 0.8 : 0.3
  end
end

# 3. Use it
order = Order.create!(total: 5000)
puts order.risk_report
# => { score: 0.8, level: :high,
#      mitigations: ["Enable fraud check"] }
```

**That's it! Your model is now risk-aware** 🎉
