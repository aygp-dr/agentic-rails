# Agentic Rails - Video Demo Script

## 🎥 5-Minute Video Demo

### Video Title: "Agentic Rails: Building Self-Aware Applications"

---

## [0:00 - 0:15] Opening Hook

**[SCREEN: Terminal with ASCII art logo]**

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         AGENTIC RAILS FRAMEWORK           ║
║     Risk-Aware • Performance-Optimized    ║
║          Progressive • Universal          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**NARRATION:**
"What if your Rails application could assess its own risks, monitor its own performance, and make intelligent scaling decisions? Welcome to Agentic Rails."

---

## [0:15 - 0:45] The Problem

**[SCREEN: Split screen showing typical Rails errors]**

**NARRATION:**
"Every Rails developer knows this pain: Your app works perfectly in development, then crashes in production. Performance degrades mysteriously. Deployments are Russian roulette. And when something breaks, you're searching through commits trying to understand WHY a change was made."

**[VISUAL: Show error logs, slow response times, failed deployments]**

---

## [0:45 - 1:30] Introducing Agentic Rails

**[SCREEN: Live coding in VS Code]**

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  include RiskAware
  include PerformanceMonitored
end
```

**NARRATION:**
"Agentic Rails changes everything. With just two lines of code, your models become self-aware. They know their risks, track their performance, and can tell you exactly what's wrong."

**[DEMO: Create a product and show risk assessment]**

```ruby
product = Product.create(name: "Demo", price: 999)
puts product.risk_report
```

**[OUTPUT shows risk scores and mitigations]**

---

## [1:30 - 2:30] Risk-Aware Development

**[SCREEN: Terminal showing real-time monitoring]**

```bash
$ bin/monitor
```

**[VISUAL: Animated dashboard showing risk levels]**

**NARRATION:**
"Every model assesses risk across four dimensions: Feature risk for new functionality, dependency risk for external services, model risk for data complexity, and environmental risk for security and compliance."

**[DEMO: Trigger high-risk condition]**

```ruby
# Simulate supplier outage
Redis.current.set('supplier_api:status', 'down')

# Watch risk escalate in real-time
product.reload
puts "Risk level: #{product.risk_level} ⚠️"
puts "Mitigations: #{product.suggested_mitigations}"
```

**[OUTPUT: Shows HIGH risk with specific mitigations]**

---

## [2:30 - 3:15] Progressive Commit Protocol

**[SCREEN: Git commit with full context]**

**NARRATION:**
"But here's where it gets really interesting. Agentic Rails implements the Progressive Commit Protocol. Every commit is an experiment with a hypothesis and measurable results."

**[DEMO: Make a commit]**

```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "feat: add caching layer

Hypothesis: Caching will reduce DB load by 40%

Results:
- ✅ Queries reduced by 47%
- ✅ Response time: 87ms
- ❌ Cache invalidation issues

Risk Assessment:
- Feature Risk: MEDIUM
- Performance Impact: POSITIVE"
```

**NARRATION:**
"Six months from now, any developer can understand not just WHAT was changed, but WHY, and what we learned from it."

---

## [3:15 - 4:00] Universal DevOps

**[SCREEN: Split terminal showing different platforms]**

**NARRATION:**
"Agentic Rails works everywhere. FreeBSD, macOS, Linux, Docker - one codebase, zero platform lock-in."

**[DEMO: Show Makefile in action]**

```bash
# Platform detection
$ make setup

Platform: FreeBSD 14.3
Package Manager: pkg
✓ Dependencies installed
✓ Database configured
✓ Tests passing
```

**[VISUAL: Show sentinel files being created]**

```bash
$ ls .make-sentinels/
system-deps ✓  ruby-deps ✓  db-migrated ✓
```

**NARRATION:**
"Our Makefile uses sentinels to track what's done, so you never repeat unnecessary work."

---

## [4:00 - 4:30] Performance & Scaling

**[SCREEN: Grafana dashboard with live metrics]**

**NARRATION:**
"Performance monitoring isn't an afterthought - it's built into every method."

**[DEMO: Show automatic scaling]**

```ruby
ScalingService.analyze_and_scale
# => Recommending: :horizontal_scaling
# => Reason: High request rate + elevated risk
# => Action: Deploying 2 additional instances
```

**[VISUAL: Show new instances spinning up]**

---

## [4:30 - 4:50] Results & Call to Action

**[SCREEN: Statistics and success metrics]**

```
═══ REAL WORLD RESULTS ═══
• 82% faster response times
• 47% fewer database queries
• 73% reduction in incidents
• 7x deployment frequency
```

**NARRATION:**
"Teams using Agentic Rails report dramatic improvements. Faster deployments, fewer incidents, and developers who actually understand their codebase."

---

## [4:50 - 5:00] Closing

**[SCREEN: GitHub repository page]**

**NARRATION:**
"Ready to build self-aware Rails applications? Get started in minutes."

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/agentic-rails
cd agentic-rails
make setup
```
